	//THINGS I FOUND OUT FOR PRE-TEST 1
	//int is for numbers (NOT decimals)
	//VERY IMPORTANT: if int is written like "Int", it is INCORRECT. capitalization is important for certain data types. 
	//don't follow with the autocorrect, only if you know it should be that way
	//boolean is for...
	//String is for words, like: String location = "San Diego";
	//  p o o  :)
	//writing this because I need some changes
	//again sigh
	
	
	
	
	//SUPER IMPORTANT STUFF I GOT FROM KAHOOT: SUPER SUPER IMPORTANT
	//primitive types (int, double, boolean, etc.), is ALWAYS lower case
	//String technically is a reference type, but you can initialitize it to a primitive
	//to know a type is primitive it turns purple when typed
	//char has an ouput like 'x'    NOT "x"â€“ those are for others like String
	//boolean is true or false
	//int are only whole numbers. decimals and cents don't count.
	//double are numbers that can have decimals and cents (probably used more for money)
