	//THINGS I NOTICED/FOUND OUT FROM THE SECOND PRE-TEST ewe
	//usually if the format is like this: new _____();, the blank space is the data type. For ex: Robot hi = new Robot(); btw, "hi" is the robot name. remember that
	//as long as the number is whole, then it is "int" (SO, NEGATIVE COUNTS)
	//if you see int in something like this:  = random.nextInt(); or Integer.parseInt(input);, you should be able to know its int because its literally shown in there
	//String is not just words it can also be a sentence
	//don't be confused if the word after the supposed data type is weird. Those usually (USUALLY) don't affect what your data type should be. ––> v down
	// so, if something is like ____ mynameishahhahapopooololstringbooleanboolean = -50;. it is still int, because it equals to a number.
	//be happy!
